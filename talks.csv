Nechey: Implementing an Image Upload and Processing Feature in Django,https://cfp-2023.djangocon.africa/admin/talks/talk/32/change/,Regular talk - 45 minutes,1,S,"<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>The implementation of an image upload and processing feature in Django is a crucial aspect of modern web applications. This abstract explores the steps involved in building such a feature using Django's powerful tools and libraries.</p>
<p>The process begins by configuring Django to handle file uploads and defining a model to store information about the uploaded images. A custom form is created to facilitate the image upload, and validation mechanisms are put in place to ensure that only valid image files are accepted.</p>
<p>To enhance user experience and improve functionality, image processing capabilities are integrated. Libraries like Pillow or OpenCV are utilized to resize, crop, apply filters, or perform other transformations on the uploaded images. These processed images are then stored securely in the designated media storage location.</p>
<p>Displaying the uploaded and processed images to users is accomplished by implementing views and templates. The Django template system is leveraged to render the images in HTML, providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface.</p>
<p>Moreover, the abstract highlights the importance of allowing users to manage their uploaded images effectively. This includes features such as editing, deleting, and organizing images into albums, ensuring a comprehensive image management solution within the Django web application.</p>
<p>By following these steps, developers can successfully implement an image upload and processing feature in Django, empowering users to seamlessly upload, process, and manage their images while enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of the web application.</p>",,,sheena,1.0
Nechey: Implementing User Authentication and Authorization in Django,https://cfp-2023.djangocon.africa/admin/talks/talk/33/change/,Regular talk - 25 minutes,1,S,"<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Implementing user authentication and authorization is a fundamental requirement for building secure web applications. This abstract explores the process of incorporating user authentication and authorization in Django, a powerful Python web framework.</p>
<p>Django provides robust tools and features that streamline the implementation of user authentication and authorization. The built-in authentication system includes a User model, which serves as the foundation for managing user accounts. Developers can extend this model or utilize its default fields to store user credentials, such as usernames, passwords, and email addresses.</p>
<p>To implement user authentication, Django offers pre-built views and forms that handle registration, login, logout, and password reset functionalities. These views and forms seamlessly integrate with the User model, allowing developers to create intuitive user interfaces for authenticating users.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Django's authorization capabilities enable developers to define access controls and permissions for different user roles. By leveraging Django's authentication middleware and decorators, developers can restrict access to specific views, allowing only authorized users to perform certain actions or access restricted areas of the application.</p>
<p>The abstract also emphasizes the importance of securing user data through proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Django's authentication system employs industry-standard techniques, such as password hashing and salting, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user credentials.</p>
<p>In summary, implementing user authentication and authorization in Django involves leveraging the framework's built-in tools, views, and models. By incorporating these features, developers can create secure web applications that authenticate users, enforce access controls, and protect sensitive user data, providing a reliable and trustworthy user experience.</p>",,,sheena,0.25

<p>Technology is how we use scientific knowledge to address challenges in the real world. Every piece of code must be developed with the intention of solving a problem in the real world. Making products with the solution as the emphasis is one of the most difficult aspects of being a developer, especially for new and somewhat experienced developers. Nowadays, writing computer programs is typically self-taught or learned at one's own pace, so the teaching-learning process concentrates more on the syntax and structure of the programs and occasionally overlooks simple but crucial components, such as algorithm design and the ability to debug codes without ""syntax errors"". Sometimes while designing algorithms, we fail to consider the procedure from the ""perspective of a computer,"" and this is typically the pathway that yields unexpected results. In order to repair such a defect, you must analyze your solution from the standpoint of your program. Therefore, it is crucial to approach algorithm design and debugging with computational thinking, which deviates slightly from our natural human ways. We need to go from a way of thinking that ignores unimportant choices and details in favor of the key ones to a methodical way of thinking that prioritizes significant ideas while paying close attention to small ones.</p>

TobeTek: Leveraging the SchemaEditor: Testing Unmanaged Models,https://cfp-2023.djangocon.africa/admin/talks/talk/57/change/,Regular talk - 25 minutes,1,S,"<p>In this captivating 20-minute talk at the Django Conference, I will take you on a journey to discover a fresh and innovative approach to leveraging Django's Schema Editor—an often overlooked tool—for editing database tables. Get ready to gain invaluable insights into the untapped potential of the Schema Editor and explore its practical applications in a niche yet vital area: testing unmanaged models.</p>
<p>To kick things off, we'll dive into the history of Django models, examining the reasons behind the need for unmanaged models and exploring scenarios where they may not be necessary. I'll address questions such as ""Why do we need unmanaged models?"" and ""When do we not need them?"" to provide a solid foundation for our exploration.</p>
<p>We'll then delve into the prevailing approach to testing unmanaged models—bootstrapping Django's test suite runner. While this solution has been widely adopted, I'll explain why I believe it can be overly complex, lacks cohesion, and unnecessarily complicates the testing workflow.</p>
<p>Next, I'll introduce an alternative solution that involves leveraging mocking techniques for the ORM and QuerySet methods/functions. By accurately setting the return values of mock stubs, we can mimic the Django ORM's API and assert the execution of specific queries, providing a quicker and less dependent approach to testing unmanaged models.</p>
<p>However, the crux of this session lies in a unique and exciting approach to testing unmanaged models using the Schema Editor. We'll explore how the Schema Editor; which usually manages background work for migrations, can be harnessed to create ""temporary"" database tables. This empowers developers to seamlessly test unmanaged models while minimizing disruptions to their existing testing workflows. I'll illustrate this approach with practical examples, share insightful code snippets, discuss the limitations, and suggest possible improvements for further exploration.</p>
<p>By the end of this talk, you'll unlock the hidden potential of Django's Schema Editor. Join me on this enlightening journey and be prepared for a paradigm shift in the way you approach testing within the Django ecosystem.</p>","When I was faced with Testing unmanaged models, the solution I got online was to monkey patch the DjangoTestSuiteRunner to treat unmanaged models the same as managed models.
I did more research, and stumbled on Django's SchemaEditor from this SO Answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/49800437.
I went on to write an [article](https://medium.com/dev-genius/unit-testing-unmanaged-models-django-93648b5e6e24), but I think this conference would be the perfect opportunity for me to share my approach with the larger Django Community.",,sheena,1.0

While the definitions generally point in the same direction, they vary widely in scope, emphasis, and detail. Strategy derives from the military definition: the plan to achieve an objective. As is typical, the basic developer concept has been expanded and grown more complex, although this does not always improve understanding of the concept. Two initial elements are needed to develop a plan to achieve an objective: a well-defined objective or objectives and an understanding of the current conditions. </p>
<p>Essentially, a strategy requires knowing where you are and where you need to go, then analyzing the gap between those two locations to determine what needs to be achieved to bridge the gap. Join Elisha during DjangoCon Africa to explore the sea of knowledge in developing world-renowned software products.</p>","The objective of the security strategy is the desired state defined by business and security attributes.

ryanhiebert: Superpowered layouts: when template inheritance falls short,https://cfp-2023.djangocon.africa/admin/talks/talk/83/change/,Regular talk - 25 minutes,1,S,"<p>Modeled after class inheritance, template inheritance is a powerful mechanism for sharing layouts between templates. Yet it is simultaneously over-complex and under-powered. </p>
<p>For example, many layouts need to have data pulled from the database and put into context. This is usually the realm of views, but if you have a layout that is shared across many views, you may have to duplicate those queries in many views, mixing layout logic with page logic. You can use context processors or custom tags, but those seem like overkill for such a common use-case.</p>
<p>There's a better way, layout views and routes. Layout routes are a major feature of Remix, a React-based center-stack framework from the creators of React Router. The way Remix leans into web standards makes it easier to see that this doesn't have to remain unique to them.</p>
<p>Together we'll explore how you can use layout views and layout routes to make the common case simpler, often without even having to specify them in your page views, and how they can help you to organize and compose your application logic and templates to keep related logic and templates closer to each other.</p>","I'm developing this idea in a sample repository here: https://github.com/ryanhiebert/temploco/blob/main/temploco/urls.py

kojoidrissa: Mastering Django By Solving Local Problems,https://cfp-2023.djangocon.africa/admin/talks/talk/95/change/,Keynote - 1 hour,2,S,"<p>Software development is primarily about problem-solving. Django, with its multiple subsystems and broad ecosystem, has many problem-solving tools. Each can be used in different ways to solve different types of problems. We call the difference between ""senior"" &amp; ""junior"" developers ""experience"". The truth is, it's a difference in problem exposure. The 'senior' has seen and had to resolve a wider range of problems. When developers try to improve their skills and gain experience, they often look at Open Source software. Since much of the Open Source world is focused around the US and Europe, they often see software built by people in those regions. And that software is often built to solve problems in those regions.</p>
<p>However, most African nations have VASTLY different needs and contexts compared to European nations or the US. This difference becomes larger when you get outside of major cities. As such, the practices and patterns used to build solutions in many parts of Africa will be different from their EU and US counterparts. And many problems encountered by African developers may not be experienced by developers outside of the continent.</p>
<p>In this talk for developers of all levels, I'll discuss a different approach to increasing your experience, both with Django and as a software developer. Building solutions that fill personal or local needs lets you leverage your specific domain knowledge. In addition to providing a local solution, you'll also build new expertise with these tools, based on problems not encountered by other developers. That experience will not only benefit African developers, it can also benefit the larger global community.</p>","I'm submitting this as a Keynote, but I can adjust it to different lengths.

A 25-minute version will focus on the presentation of the core idea. A 45-minute version will add a bit more theory and examples.

It's like finding the right heart for your community's body! So, take a moment to think about what your community needs and where you want it to go. The platform you choose should be like a magnet, pulling in members from all corners, and making sure everyone feels included.
Go through the features and tools it offers; think of it as a playground where your community members can have endless fun and possibilities. Make sure it can grow with your community as it expands, like a tree that keeps getting taller and stronger. Security and privacy are crucial – they're like the walls that protect your community's little home from unwanted visitors.
And remember, every community needs a caretaker – someone to watch over it and make sure everyone is happy. So, look for a platform that offers excellent community management and support. But, of course, budget matters too. Think of it as the icing on the cake; the sweeter, the better, but it shouldn't break the bank!

nyior: Optimising Microservices Communication with Asynchronous Messaging: A Django Developer's Perspective,https://cfp-2023.djangocon.africa/admin/talks/talk/79/change/,Regular talk - 25 minutes,0,S,"<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Microservices provide a powerful framework, and building each service in the architecture is usually the easiest part. But most times, these services do not exist in isolation. So you need to coordinate and get them to communicate. And this is where threads of complexity start to unravel.</p>
<p>As far as communication in microservices goes, two popular approaches grace the stage: synchronous https and asynchronous lightweight messaging. In theory, https-based microservices might appear more straightforward to implement due to their familiar request-response nature. However, in reality, they have some major limitations.</p>
<p>For example, https-based microservices tend to be more coupled, and have more complex load-balancing and service discovery mechanisms amongst others.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will interrogate these drawbacks of https-based microservices and explore how message queueing can address these challenges. We will put the entire conversation in the context of building microservices with Django</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Hopefully Django developers that are not so familiar with message queues and the benefits of using them as the communication medium in a microservice architecture</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To help the audience see more clearly the benefits of using message queues over HTTP for inter-service communication in a microservice architecture</p>","- Just to clarify, I'm the only person giving this talk. The platform automatically selected joseph wambugu(or maybe I mistakenly did) - Please, kindly disregard that. James is not my co-author

I'm not so sure about the current title - here are some alternatives I have in mind:

- HTTP-based vs Queue-based Django Microservices
- Embrace the Power of Message Queueing in your Django Microservices

EvaNan: Testing for GOATS,https://cfp-2023.djangocon.africa/admin/talks/talk/109/change/,Regular talk - 25 minutes,1,S,"<p>In today's landscape, APIs have become the backbone of modern web development, enabling seamless communication between client applications and servers. However, real-world scenarios often involve complex interactions with external services that return data dynamically, making traditional testing approaches challenging. This talk will focus on mocking classes that return data that the application will use to complete a transaction.</p>
<p>We use unittest's Mock class to return a value that will be used in the application's api request to simulate responses from external services.
The talk will cover the fundamentals of Django's testing framework and explore the standard methods for testing API endpoints, using a real-world case study, to demonstrate how mocking classes can address intricate testing challenges.</p>
<p>Participants will leave with an understanding of the best practices around handling asynchronous API calls and exploring how mocks can ensure consistent and reliable testing of Django's asynchronous capabilities. We will also discuss strategies for testing edge cases, such as API timeouts, rate limiting, and data inconsistencies, with mock classes, empowering developers to proactively tackle potential issues of incurring costs on testing API connections and failures in production due to untested code.</p>

daniele: And all that jazz,https://cfp-2023.djangocon.africa/admin/talks/talk/110/change/,Regular talk - 45 minutes,1,S,"<p>Django is named for a legendary jazz musician. Why? And does it matter? I think it does, and it tells us something about Django. What else can we find in jazz that helps us understand our work as Python programmers?</p>
<p>In jazz, a new language of music was invented, by outsiders; they took existing resources and tools, and made something unexpected and new out of them - and it was so powerful, that it changed the course of music itself. Perhaps that's a model of possibility for African <em>programmers</em> too. Later, Afrofuturism - a movement that applies African culture to technological speculation - emerged from jazz. Once again, it's something suggests possibilities for an African rethinking of technology.</p>
<p>In this talk I will explore what happens at the intersection of creativity, technology and ""outsider"" cultures, and ask whether it can give us any clues about the future of African software and technologists.</p>",,,Anna,2.0

Preshh0: Keep Talking: The Importance of Conversations around DEI.,https://cfp-2023.djangocon.africa/admin/talks/talk/114/change/,Regular talk - 25 minutes,0,S,"<p>""Keep Talking: The Importance of Conversations around DEI"" is a talk focused on the importance of conversations around DEI and why they should be had.</p>
<p>It is focused on raising awareness to open-source contributors, leaders, maintainers, enthusiasts, curious people, and even non-OSS organisations. Emphasizing the critical role of the limitations of non-DEI policies, and the difference/importance of effecting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) measures in fostering thriving, innovative, inclusive and healthy open source communities, the session underscores the power of dialogue as a catalyst for meaningful change and inclusivity within open-source projects.</p>
<p>Conversations are the backbone of open-source communities, facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing. However, DEI conversations go beyond project discussions; they create an environment of understanding and empathy. By actively listening and embracing diverse perspectives, contributors build trust and respect, enabling marginalized voices to be heard and valued. These conversations also address systemic inequalities, challenging biases, and promoting inclusive practices.</p>
<p>Open-source contributors can drive significant change by engaging in DEI discussions. By uncovering blind spots, identifying areas for improvement, and developing actionable solutions, they can create safe spaces for open dialogue. Leadership plays a pivotal role in championing DEI efforts, inspiring others to follow suit, and ensuring that fairness and inclusion permeate the community. “Keep Talking” calls on every contributor to shape an open-source world that embraces, and encourages dialogue, celebrates diversity, and creates a more inclusive and equitable future for all.</p>","No, there are no extra notes I have.
